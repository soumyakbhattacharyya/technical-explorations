# **Food Delivery System**

Online food delivery is very common and many use it on every other day.

Considering that you have used or have observed people using food delivery apps, we would require you to analyze, design and implement a solution manifesting an online food delivery system.

We would expect the design to cater to at least 3 of the following use cases.

1. User should be able to register and login into the system.
2. User should get to see the list of nearby restaurants which are available for home delivery based on location.
3. User should get to see the menu of the selected restaurant.
4. All select items from the menu should get added in the cart along with total amount.
5. A user should be restricted place the order from single restaurant i.e.. user must not be able to include different items from different restaurant in same order.
6. A discount should get calculated automatically if a user apply any voucher.
7. User should get current and historical order information in his/her account.

Note: There is no need to implement payment. Once items are selected, voucher applied and final sum is calculated, a submission (any click) is good enough to consider that order is placed.
