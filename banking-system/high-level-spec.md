# Banking System

As we are living in digital era, online banking is becoming a preferable option for many of us instead of physically visiting a branch.  

Considering that almost all of us have basic knowledge about how a banking system work along with what all facilities a bank provides to its customers, the purpose of this assignment is to simulate the functionality.  You need to analyze, design and implement a solution covering widely used facilities of banking systems by their consumers.

We would expect the design to cater to at least 3 of the following use cases.

1. A *new user* of internet banking should be able to *register* him/herself by providing either account information (account number, his/her name, date of birth) or debit card information (card number, name on the card and expiry date). A successful registration would imply that user receives a notification containing username and password to login into the system.
2. A registered user is able to update his/her *profile*.
3. A registered user is able to view details of the *accounts* associated with his/her profile.
4. A registered user is able to view last 5 *transactions* for each of the accounts associated with his/her profile.
5. A registered user is able to add a *payee* and transfer the money.
6. A registered user is able to block a stolen *card*.
