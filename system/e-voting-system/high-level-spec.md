# **E-Voting System**

As we still follow the system of giving vote on voting booth, this kind of system does not exist at the moment in India. Albeit e-voting is a difficult system to build, keeping security as main aspect in mind, the purpose of this assignment is to think, design and implement a small prototype for this kind of requirement if ever exist.

You are free to implement use cases seems right to you as this would be a completely new system which nobody has experienced yet anytime.

However just for reference, following are the subset of requirements you can think over.

1. A voter should be able to register him/herself using valid voter card no.
2. User should get to see the list of districts where voting will take place.
3. User should only be able to explore district which s/he is eligible for.
4. User should get to see the list of parties and their symbols.
5. One the day of election user should be able to submit their vote.
6. On the day of result user should get to see results of every district irrespective of the eligibility.
