# **Bus Reservation System**

Online bus reservation is commonly availed facility these days. 

Considering that almost all of us have basic knowledge about how we use a booking service provider like Redbus or equivalent, the purpose of this assignment is to simulate the functionality.  You need to analyze, design and implement a solution covering widely used facilities of bus reservation system.

We would expect the design to cater to at least 3 of the following use cases.

1. A new user should be able to register to the system, using email id as user identity.
2. On being registered the user would receive a notification. Using personal detail s/he should be able to login into the system.
3. User should be able to filter buses based on source, destination and timings.
4. User should be able to book a seat in the selected bus.
5. User should be navigated to payment page once all mandatory information has been filled up.
6. User should be able to view all his/her upcoming journeys.
7. User should be able to view the historical data of his/her journey.

Note: please assume, that the system has data about available buses, their routes, timings etc. already stored.
