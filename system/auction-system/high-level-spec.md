# **Auction System**

Auction is a place where seller can keep their things on sale without any price tag on them. 

This way they allow buyers to bid their price for that item. 

Interested buyers bid higher and higher based on the worth of the value and finally highest bidder won the auction for particular item. 

We need you to analyze, design and implement a prototype for this kind of requirements.

For reference, following are the subset of requirements you can think over.

1. Sellers and buyers of antiques should be able to register themselves and login into the system.

2. Sellers should be able to create item by providing certain information about what they are selling.

3. An auction coordinator (admin) should be able to create auction events with event start and end dates.

4. An auction coordinator (admin) should be able to associate items created by seller in specific auction event.

5. All buyers should get list of auction events live at that time.

6. All buyers should get list if associated items created for auction on expanding any auction event.

7. All buyers should be able to bid on any item they want which is available for auction.

8. Once Auction event has crossed end date, buyer who placed max bid should win.

9. Winning info can be shown on the item itself which is sold.
